### About Me

Since 2023, I have been studying at Hive Helsinki, developing my coding skills through immersive, project-based learning. Alongside my education at Hive, I’ve taken additional courses like the IBM Full-Stack JavaScript Developer program, FastAPI Web Service Development, and PostgreSQL Database Management, further expanding my knowledge. I have thoroughly enjoyed every project I have undertaken regardless of the tech stack. This experience has reinforced my passion for coding, and I’m eager to continue my journey in a professional capacity. I am open to exploring any domain of software development, excited to keep learning, and ready to contribute to new projects and teams. As a career changer with a background in project management, I’ve successfully led and managed projects, which has sharpened my ability to collaborate and solve problems. Now, I am ready to apply these skills in a software engineering role and contribute to meaningful, impactful work.
