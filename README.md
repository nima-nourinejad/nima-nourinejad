### About Me

Since 2023, I have been studying at Hive Helsinki, focusing on coding fundamentals through project-based learning. Some of my key projects include building a web server in C++, implementing a multi-threaded simulation, and creating a custom Unix shell in C. These projects have strengthened my understanding of system-level programming and concurrency management.

In addition to my school projects, I have developed APIs using Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, as well as front-end applications with JavaScript, deepening my understanding of data flow from the database to the user interface.

As a career changer with a background in project management, Iâ€™ve successfully managed multiple projects simultaneously and collaborated effectively with teams. This experience has helped me develop strong skills in organization, problem-solving, and attention to detail.
