### About Me

Enthusiastic software developer. Passionate about learning and solving complex problems. Ready to grow in a professional environment.

At Hive Helsinki, I tackled diverse challenges and honed my skills across various programming languages and technologies.

I value the guidance of senior developers. I listen closely. I learn eagerly. I thrive in a team. Collaboration inspires me. I grow through shared knowledge.  

At the same time, I am initiative-driven and thrive on tackling complex challenges. At Hive, this is the standard approach: you receive one challenge.  And,  you must navigate it on your own. I enjoy getting immersed in learning and exploring various possibilities. I continually refine my approach until I discover the best solution.
